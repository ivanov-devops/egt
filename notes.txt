## The Task:
0. Clone the repository locally
1. Do a presentation on building CI and CD solution for the application, note the fact that we are deploying on Bare-Metal, thus the deployment should happen with Ansible or BASH
2. Add in the presentation some info on implementing monitoring solution to servers, where the application will be deployed
3. Prepare a running Docker-Compose recipe for local development environment
4. Prepare a sample workflow with Jenkins, using groovy on building the application and storing its artifacts to either Nexus NPM and Maven repositories
5. Prepare a small guide, intended for the developers/qa engineers, what do they have on their machines, to work with the application
6. Commit the presentation, the docker-compose recipe, the Jenkinsfile and the guide to the local repository
7. Provide us with a copy of the repository via email and present a working solution on the technical interview


0  Done
1. Depends
   - first there are no parameters for the current task.
   - One option is to create ansible playbook so I made example but without real usage
   - Second option - via Jenkins
   - Third option - via Gitlab

2. The monitoring solution also depends of the case, we can use stack like TickStack, ELK, DataDog, or Prometheus.
3. Done - the file is docker-compose.yml
4. Done - two files Jenkinsfile - the variables there are not set because also depends of the repo, registry etc.
5. Done - small changes are in the README file - `Setup for localdev`.
